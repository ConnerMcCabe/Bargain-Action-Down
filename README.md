# Bargain Action Down
### Introduction: 
Bargain Action Down is a task tracker for your spending activities, that encourages you to spend less to score more. Once you have a task in mind you can bargain that down and render your new activity, scoring points based on potential money saved. Points are recorded as tasks are completed and your savings are converted quantities of things you could do with your savings
